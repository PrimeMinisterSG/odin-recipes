    <h2>This is Fried Chicken which you can eat</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my recipe website where I will explain all about where 
        I first ate a particular food and why it means so much to me. I will go
        into way too much detail telling you about that before actually 
        getting to the recipe. 
    </p>
    <p>When I was 13 my parents let me out of my bedroom for the first time and drove me to KFC
        where I was given a trough of fried chicken to roll in. I will always
        remember my dad telling me to get out of the chicken trough, it was the 
    first thing he ever said to me.
